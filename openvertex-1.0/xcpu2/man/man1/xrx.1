.SH NAME
\fBxrx \fP- execute commands on \fBxcpu\fP(4) nodes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
\fBxrx\fP [\fB-dhlsaLp\fP] [\fB-e\fP \fIexec\fP] [\fB-n\fP \fIsessions\fP] [\fB-j\fP \fIjobid\fP] [\fB-c\fP \fIcwd\fP] [\fB-J\fP \fIjobid\fP] \fInodes\fP \fIprogram\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxrx\fP executes a binary on an \fBxcpu\fP(4) node or attaches to a session already in progress.
The remote node where the job is to execute should be running \fBxcpufs\fP(4). Xrx will execute
the command "\fIprogram\fP" on the set of \fInodes\fP specified by "\fInodes\fP", which should be given
in the \fBxcpu\fP(4) format. 
.PP
If "\fIprogram\fP" is a binary it will be copied to the remote machine
(together with all libraries it depends on, if the \fB-s\fP switch is given). If "\fIprogram\fP" is a 
directory, all contents of the directory will be copied and the file name supplied with \fB-e\fP
will be executed.
.PP
The standard I/O of \fBxrx\fP becomes the standard I/O of the executing \fIprogram\fP so piping to and from
\fBxrx\fP works. If the name of the \fIprogram\fP to be executed is not absolute \fBxrx\fP will attempt to execute
a binary of that name found in one of the directories listed in the PATH environment variable.
.PP
Attempting to execute a binary on a computer of a different architecture than the local node
will attempt to copy a binary located in XCPU_SYSROOT/arch, where arch is the architecture as
reported by the remote machine.
