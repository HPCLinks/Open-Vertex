.SH NAME
\fBxcpu \fP- the xcpu cluster management framework
.SH DESCRIPTION
xcpu is a suite for accessing resources, executing jobs and managing
nodes in a cluster configuration. Xcpu contains a set of servers running
on remote nodes or a head node and a set of client programs and
libraries which can be used to communicate with the servers or write
applications that access them. 
.PP
Xcpu servers and clients use the 9P protocol to communicate with each
other. All xcpu servers present their resources as files, essentially 
acting as user-level file servers. The files can either be accessed 
via the network or mounted locally using \fBv9fs\fP(5).
.PP
A client starts a session on an xcpu node by opening and reading from
the "/clone" file served by xcpufs. The string read from the clone file
contains the name of a newly created directory within that file server.
The client then copies all binaries, libraries and input files
pertaining to that session to the subdirectory called "fs/" within the
session directory. If necessary, the client sets up the environment for
the new process by writing to the "env" file in the session directory.
The end step is to write the "exec" command which will execute the
binary. The client then proceeds to write to the "stdin" file and to
read from "stdout" and "stderr", which correspond to the newly started
process' standard I/O file descriptors. When a session is completed and
no clients are holding any files open, the session directory will be
removed from the file server, together with any remaining files copied
from the client or created by the executing process.
.PP
An xcpu client can control one or more processes running
on one or more nodes if more than a single node was specified
as the target address for the new session. Clients specify
one or more nodes for accessing using a comma-separated
nodeset description. The format of a nodeset description
is simply a comma-separated list of the node names/ip
addresses of the nodes to access, or a name followed by a
square bracketed list of digits to be expanded. For example
"node[1-10]" expands to "node1,node2,\.\.\.,node10".
.PP
All file servers in xcpu can be mounted by clients with the
appropriate permissions. They can also be mounted in the
local file system via the \fBv9fs\fP(5) kernel module. Clients
can mount remote nodes via a Plan 9-like "session address"
specifier. The format of the session address is [tcp!]node[!port]
where the 'tcp' string can be omitted and if !port is not
specified the default will be used.
.PP
Listed below are the main components of xcpu:
.TP
.B
\fBXcpufs\fP(4)
The main file server running on computational nodes. Xcpufs
is the only daemon that clients interface with to start
jobs, manage or obtain the status of a machine in an xcpu
cluster.
.TP
.B
\fBStatfs\fP(4)
File server which provides access to the status of a set
of remote nodes.
.TP
.B
\fBSpfs\fP(3)
Library for creating 9P file servers.
.TP
.B
\fBSpclient\fP(3)
Library for connecting to and operating on 9P file
servers.
.TP
.B
\fBXcpu\fP(3)
Library for connecting to and executing commands on \fBxcpufs\fP(4)
servers
.TP
.B
\fBStrutil\fP(3)
Helper library for manipulating strings
.TP
.B
\fBXrx\fP(1)
Run commands on \fBxcpufs\fP(4) servers
.TP
.B
\fBXk\fP(1)
Send signals to processes and jobs running on \fBxcpufs\fP(4) servers
.TP
.B
\fBXps\fP(1)
Show processes running on remote nodes
.TP
.B
\fBXstat\fP(1)
Show status of remote nodes
.SH COMPILING AND INSTALLATION
Xcpu file servers and utilities should compile on all UNIX and UNIX-like
systems. If you're compiling xcpu for a non-Linux system you should
compile and install \fBlibelf\fP(3) from the GNU repository.
.SH EXAMPLE
To start xcpufs on a machine named mach1:
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                $ xcpufs &

.fam T
.fi
To execute a simple command on machines named "node1" through "node10":
.PP
.nf
.fam C
                $ xrx mach1 date

.fam T
.fi
