Installation Instructions
*************************

On the VERTEX node do this. 
 
./configure
make
make install

Then edit /usr/local/vertex/etc/vex.conf
  - add hostnames for the compute nodes to this file. 
    For example n1:2:4
    where 2 is the number of cores on the compute node n1

Distribution of RSA keys to the compute nodes

Before user applications can be executed remotely on compute nodes, the ssh key should be generated on vertex node and distributed to each of the compute nodes.

Example:
On vertex node (as root):
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f admin_key
mkdir /etc/xcpu
cp admin_key* /etc/xcpu

Once the key pair is generated, copy the key pair to each compute node at the location /etc/xcpu/


Adding or Deleting users
Use the standard Linux command to create/delete users. Refer example below.

Example:
Let.s say the new user id that needs to be created is .roy..  Follow steps given below on vertex node:

1. Create user id
    > useradd .u 502 .g 501 roy
   Here the new user is added to the existing group id .501.. 
2. Generate RSA key-pair for this user under the default /home/roy/.ssh/
    > ssh-keygen .t rsa
NOTE: it is important that for the new user the key pair is generated otherwise the applications executed by this user will not run on compute nodes.



Then copy the tarball to your compute nodes then do this on the compute nodes.

./configure 
make 
make computenode-install
/etc/init.d/vertex start



Then start vertex on the vertex node

/etc/init.d/vertex start


If you have a cluster of vertex nodes, you can see more details in the 
VERTEX manual in /usr/share/doc/vertex
