Welcome to Open-Vertex. 

VERTEX is a hybrid HPC platform architecture where "VERTEX" control nodes
transparently connect light-weight heterogeneous compute nodes to storage and
system services. Open-Vertex is an open source implementation of VERTEX 
developed by HPCLinks and maintained on github. 

A subcomponent of Open-Vertex is the open source package called XCPU2.  
Open-Vertex contains a fork of the XCPU2 because the VERTEX objectives are 
significantly different than XCPU2 and XCPU2 maintenance has subsided. 
We are grateful to the XCPU2 developers for giving us a strong platform to 
start with. 

VERTEX address the challenges posed by today's Hybrid HPC systems that use
traditional CPUs as well as compute intensive processors such as GPGPUs, 
many-core, and Cell processors on the same HPC system.  By employing a set of 
unique features, VERTEX provides unprecedented levels of ease-of-use, 
flexibility and scalability for commodity hybrid HPC systems.
