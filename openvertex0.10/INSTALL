Installation Instructions
*************************

On the VERTEX node do this. 
 
./configure
make
make install

Then edit /usr/local/vertex/etc/vex.conf
  - add hostnames for the compute nodes to this file. 
    For example n1:2:4
    where 2 is the number of cores on the compute node n1


Then copy the tarball to your compute nodes then do this on the compute nodes.

./configure 
make 
make computenode-install
/etc/init.d/vertex start


Then start vertex on the vertex node

/etc/init.d/vertex start

If you have a cluster of vertex nodes, you can see more details in the 
VERTEX manual in /usr/share/doc/vertex
